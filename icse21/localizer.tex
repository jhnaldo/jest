\subsection{Bug Localizer}

In the bug detection/localization phase, \textsf{Bug Localizer} detects and
localizes bugs based on the execution results of given conformance tests on
multiple JavaScript engines.  If most of engines fails to a specific
conformance test, we believe that the failure of the test represents the
correct semantics.  Thus, we suspect engines passing the test and the
specification of containing bugs related to the test.  Otherwise, we assume
that bugs exist in engines failing the test.

After targeting a poterntially buggy engine or specification with failed tests,
we utilize Spectrum Based Fault Localization (SBFL)\cite{sbfl-survey}, which is
which is a ranking technique based on likelihood of being faulty for each
program element.  We use the following basic formula introduced by Jones et
al. with a tool Tarantula\cite{tarantula, tarantula2}:
\[
  {{n_{ef}}\over{n_{ef} + n_{nf}}} /
  \left(
    {{n_{ef}}\over{n_{ef} + n_{nf}}} +
    {{n_{ef}}\over{n_{ep} + n_{np}}}
  \right)
\]
where $n_{ef}$, $n_{ep}$ , $n_{ep}$, and $n_{np}$ represent the number of test
cases; subscripts ${}_e$ and ${}_n$ represent whether the test case touched the
relevant program elements or not, and subscripts ${}_f$ and ${}_p$ represent
whether the test case is failed or passed.
