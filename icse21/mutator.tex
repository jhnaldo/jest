\subsection{Program Mutator}

Given a target program, \textsf{Program Mutator} tries to mutate the program
in to another program that increase sematics coverage.  One trial consists of
the following steps.
First, it selects one of the 5 transformers(?). The role
of transformer is to simply modify the given program. Detailed explnation of each
transformer will be described in subsection.  Probability of choosing a centain
transformer depends on the given program, so that more promising transformer have
better chance to be selected.
Second, the chosen transformer is applied to the given program.  Then, the semantics
coverage of the generated program is computed.  If it increases the total semntics
coverage, then we say the trail is succesful.
This process is repeated at most predefined maximum trial number.  If there was a successful
trial, then \textsf{Program Mutator} will give the result of succesful trial as the final output.
Otherwise, we say that the mutator fails for the specific program.

\subsubsection{Simple Replacer}
Simple Replacer is rather simple transformer.  It traverse the AST of the given program
and whenenver it meets Statment, Declaration, AssignmentExpression or PrimaryExpression node,
it replace that node with another node with 50 percent probability.  The node that will be inserted
is generated from \textsf{Seed Synthesizer}.  //TODO: manual sampler?

\subsubsection{Near-Syntax Replacer}
Near-Syntax replacer is a smarter transformer compared to Simple Replacer.

\subsubsection{String Replacer}
String Replacer also take advantage of target branch information, as Near-Syntax replacer does.

\subsubsection{Object Replacer}
Object replacer is a transformer specialized in inserting objects.  What is does is to 
randomly replace the PrimaryExpression node with randomly synthesized object.
This replacer has higher chance to be selected when the target script expects
objects.
(Q: Primary Expression에 대한 설명이 필요한가?)

\subsubsection{Statement Appender}
StatementAppender is a transformer that appends a statement at the end of each statement list.
This could happen at top level statement list, inside block, or at function body.  The statement
to be appended is selected from \text{Seed Synthesizer}. The statemnts that have better potential
to change the execution path, such as funciton call, return, break, or throw, have higher chance
to be selected.
