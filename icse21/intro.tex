\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\begin{itemize}
  \item JavaScript was initially designed for client-side programming in web
    browsers, but nowadays diverse JavaScript engines have been developed and
    actively used in various fields.
  \item Such JavaScript engines should comply with ECMAScript, which is the
    official specification that describes syntax and semantics of JavaScript
    managed by The Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39).
  \item However, it is a challenging task to test that existing JavaScript
    engines satisfy requirements described in ECMAScript.  One possible way is
    to use conformance tests.
  \item While the committee provides Test262, the official conformance test
    suite for ECMAScript, the test suite is manually written thus they might
    have different semantics with the specification or not cover all the cases.
  \item Moreover, ECMAScript is annually updated from ECMAScript 6 (ES6, 2015)
    to support new language features in response to users' demands.  This frequent
    update makes harder to write conformance tests in manual.
  \item To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel approach to generate
    conformance tests directly from ECMAScript. Our approach consits of three
    steps: 1) to randomly generate JavaScript programs guided by syntax, 2)
    to mutate them to increase branch coverage in ECMAScript, and 3) to inject
    assertions into them to check the final program state.
  \item An additional effect of our approach is to detect specification errors.
    Because generated tests strictly comply given ECMAScript, they also reflect
    the specification errors might exist in the specification.  When most of
    JavaScript engines fail to pass a specific test, the test might be highly
    related to the specification errors in ECMAScript.
  \item We implement this idea in $\tool$, which is a JavaScript Engine
    Conformance Tester.  It has the following technical contributions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item we develop $\tool$, which is the first tool that automatically
        generates conformance tests for JavaScript engines from ECMAScript.
      \item We first measure the branch coverage of Test262, the official
        conformance tests, and the conformance tests generated by our tool
        defeats the coverage of Test262.
      \item We apply our tool to \inred{X} JavaScript engines that supports the
        lastest version of ECMAScript (ES11, 2020).  Based on the test results,
        we found \inred{XX} errors in \inred{XXXX} and \inred{XX} errors in
        \inred{XXXX}. Moreover, we found \inred{XX} specification errors in
        ES11.
