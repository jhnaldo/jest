\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

We have following three research questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item RQ1. \textbf{Efficiency:} How many tests are generated by $\tool$
    compared with the number of tests in Test262?
  \item RQ1. \textbf{Coverage:} How much parts of ECMAScript are covered by
    generated conformance tests compared with Test262?
  \item RQ2. \textbf{Bug Detection in JS Engines:} How many errors are detected
    in real-world JavaScript engines?
  \item RQ3. \textbf{Bug Detection in ECMAScript:} How many specification errors
    are detected in the most recent version of ECMAScript (ES11)?
\end{itemize}
