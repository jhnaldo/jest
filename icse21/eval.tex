\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

We have following three research questions:

Evaluation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf RQ1 (Completeness of Test Generation)} Coverage compared to Test262
    %, the official conformance test suite for ECMAScript
  \item {\bf RQ2 (Effectiveness of Test Generation)} Depth, number of tests,
    time to generate them, $\cdots$
  \item {\bf RQ3 (Bug Detection in JavaScript Engines)}
  \item {\bf RQ4 (Bug Detection in ECMAScript)}
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item RQ1. \textbf{Efficiency:} How many tests are generated by $\tool$
%     compared with the number of tests in Test262?
%   \item RQ1. \textbf{Coverage:} How much parts of ECMAScript are covered by
%     generated conformance tests compared with Test262?
%   \item RQ2. \textbf{Bug Detection in JS Engines:} How many errors are detected
%     in real-world JavaScript engines?
%   \item RQ3. \textbf{Bug Detection in ECMAScript:} How many specification errors
%     are detected in the most recent version of ECMAScript (ES11)?
% \end{itemize}
