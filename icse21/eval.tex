\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

To evaluate $\tool$ that performs the $N$+1-differential testing of JavaScript
engines and specification, we applied our tool to four JavaScript engines that
fully support modern JavaScript features and the most recent specification,
ECMAScript 2020 (ES11, 2020).  We targeted the following four JavaScript
engines and all of them supports
ES11\footnote{https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs\#current-status}\footnote{https://bellard.org/quickjs/}\footnote{https://blog.moddable.com/blog/xs10/}\footnote{https://v8.dev/}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GraalJS (v20.1.0):} A JavaScript implementation built on
    GraalVM\cite{graaljs}, which is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) based on
    HotSpot/OpenJDK developed by Oracle.
  \item \textbf{QuickJS (2020-04-12):} A small and embedded JavaScript engine developed by
    Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon\cite{qjs}.
  \item \textbf{Moddable XS (v10.2.1):} A JavaScript engine at the center of the Moddable
    SDK\cite{xs}, which is a combination of development tools and runtime
    software to create applications for microcontrollers.
  \item \textbf{V8 (v8.5):} The Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and
    WebAssembly engine\cite{v8}, written in C++.
\end{itemize}
We performed our experiments on a machine equipped with 4.0GHz Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-6700k and 32GB of RAM (Samsung DDR4 2133MHz 8GB $\times$ 4).  We evaluated our
tool based on the following four research questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf RQ1 (Coverage of Generated Tests)} The semantics coverage compared
    to Test262, the official conformance test suite for ECMAScript.
  \item {\bf RQ2 (Practicality of Test Generation)} The practicality based on
    the number of tests, the generation time, and execution time on engines.
  \item {\bf RQ3 (Bug Detection in JavaScript Engines)} The number of bugs in
    four JavaScript engines detected by $\tool$.
  \item {\bf RQ4 (Bug Detection in ECMAScript)} The number of specification bugs
    on ES11detected by $\tool$.
\end{itemize}
