\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

Our technique is related to two research fields: differential testing and
fuzzing.

\textbf{Differential Testing:} Differential testing~\cite{???} utilizes multiple
implementations as cross-referencing oracles to find semantics bugs.
Researchers applied this technique for various applications, such as Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) implementations~\cite{???}, web applications~\cite{???},
and binary lifters~\cite{ir-diff-test}.  Moreover, \textsc{Nezha} introduces a
guided differential testing tool with the concept of $\delta$-diversity to
efficiently find semantic bugs.  However, it has fundametal limitations because
it uses only the cross-referencing oracles and targets implementations.  Our
approach extends the idea of differential testing with not only $N$ different
implementations but also a mechanized specification to test both of them.

\textbf{Fuzzing:} \inred{TODO}
